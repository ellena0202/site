        <h3>Professional</h3>
        <p class="code-skill-description">A few skills that I have honed and have become proficient at over the years are: Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. I have learned these skills through my years as a student studying Computer Science. I am always looking to learn new aspects of each coding language to improve my skill set. Not only this, but I am also ready to study languages I haven't yet touched to add them to my coding toolbox.</p>

        <h3>Creative</h3>
        <p>On the other side of the coin, I am not only technical, but am extremely artistic. For as long as I can remember I have been drawing, painting, and creating. In the past few years I have painted more than ever, and have even brought my art off the canvas, and into the kitchen - specifically on cakes. As I am discovering new scopes for my love of art, new creations are always on the horizon.</p>
